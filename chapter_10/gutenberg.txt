The subject-matter of this book is a historical summary of the
development of mathematics, illustrated by the lives and discoveries of
those to whom the progress of the science is mainly due. It may serve as
an introduction to more elaborate works on the subject, but primarily
it is intended to give a short and popular account of those leading facts
in the history of mathematics which many who are unwilling, or have
not the time, to study it systematically may yet desire to know.
The first edition was substantially a transcript of some lectures
which I delivered in the year 1888 with the object of giving a sketch of
the history, previous to the nineteenth century, that should be intelligible
to any one acquainted with the elements of mathematics. In the
second edition, issued in 1893, I rearranged parts of it, and introduced
a good deal of additional matter.
The scheme of arrangement will be gathered from the table of contents
at the end of this preface. Shortly it is as follows. The first chapter
contains a brief statement of what is known concerning the mathematics
of the Egyptians and Phoenicians; this is introductory to the history
of mathematics under Greek influence. The subsequent history is divided
into three periods: first, that under
Greek influence, chapters ii
to vii; second, that of the middle ages and renaissance, chapters viii
to xiii; and lastly that of modern times, chapters xiv to xix.
In discussing the mathematics of these periods I have confined myself
to giving the leading events in the history, and frequently have
passed in silence over men or works whose influence was comparatively
unimportant. Doubtless an exaggerated view of the discoveries of those
mathematicians who are mentioned may be caused by the non-allusion
to minor writers who preceded and prepared the way for them, but in
all historical sketches this is to some extent inevitable, and I have done
my best to guard against it by interpolating remarks on the progress
